# Remindy

Remindy — an example minimal reminder application (Flutter, Provider, Material 3).

Summary
- Project structure: `lib/` contains `main.dart`, `app.dart`, `models/`, `providers/`, `screens/`, and `widgets/`.
- State management: `provider`
- Key packages: `provider`, `intl`, `uuid`, `flutter_slidable`, `fl_chart`, `google_fonts`

Prerequisites (Windows)
- Flutter SDK installed and available in `PATH`
- Android Studio with Android SDK (Platform, Platform-tools, Command-line tools)
- An AVD (emulator) configured in Android Studio (for example, `Pixel_7`)

Usage (from the project folder `D:\8\remindy`)

1) Install dependencies:
```powershell
flutter pub get
```

2) Run on Windows desktop:
```powershell
flutter run -d windows
```

3) Run on Chrome (web):
```powershell
flutter run -d chrome
```

4) Run on an Android emulator (example):
```powershell
flutter emulators
flutter emulators --launch <emulatorId>
flutter run -d <deviceId>
```

Android build troubleshooting (if encountered)
- If you see an error such as "NDK ... did not have a source.properties file" or Gradle build failures, the NDK download may be incomplete.
- Suggested fixes:
  1. Close any running emulator and Android Studio.
  2. Remove the NDK folder mentioned in the error (for example: `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\28.2.13676358`).
  3. Open Android Studio → SDK Manager → SDK Tools → check `NDK (Side by side)` and apply to redownload.
  4. Alternatively, run `flutter run` again; Gradle/Android plugin may download the missing components automatically (requires internet).

Additional information
- Open the project in VS Code: `code .` (from the project root)
- To build a release or sign an APK/AAB, configure the `android/` directory according to the Flutter documentation.

Next steps (I can help):
- Want me to try removing a corrupted NDK and re-run `flutter run`? (reply `fix-ndk`)
- Need a screenshot of the app running on Windows or an emulator? (reply `screenshot`)
- Want me to make small, focused UI tweaks? (reply `tweak`)
